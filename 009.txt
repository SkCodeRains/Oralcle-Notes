OPERATORS IN ORALCE:
=====================
	- TO PERFORM SOME OPERATIONS ON GIVEN OPERAND VALUES.

1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR		=>	=
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS		=>	+ , - , * , /
3. RELATIONAL / COMPARISON OPERA	=>	< , > , <= , >=, != 
4. LOGICAL OPERATORS		=>	AND,OR,NOT
5. SET OPERATORS			=>	UNION,UNION ALL,INTERSECT,MINUS

6. SPECIAL OPERATORS		=>	(+ve) OPERATOR		(-ve) OPERATORS
					==============		================
					IN			NOT IN
					BETWEEN		NOT BETWEEN
					IS NULL			IS NOT NULL
					LIKE			NOT LIKE


1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:
========================
	- TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO VARIABLE / TO ATTRIBUTE(COLUMN)

SYNTAX:
=======
	<COLUMN NAME> <ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR> <VALUE>

EX:
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO = 7788 ;

2. ARITHEMATIC OPERATORS:
==========================
	- TO PERFORM MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS LIKE ADD,SUB,MUL ,DIV.

SYNTAX:
=======
	<COLUMN NAME> <ARITHMETIC OPERATOR> <VALUE>

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYEE SALARIES AFTER ADDING 1000 ?

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY ENAME,SALARY AND ANNUAL SALARY OF EMPLOYEE FROM EMP TABLE?

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEE SALARIES AFTER INCREMENT WITH 10% WHO ARE WORKING IN DEPTNO IS 20 ?

3) RELATIONAL OPERATORS:
=========================
	- COMPARING A SPECIFIC COLUMN VALUES WITH USER DEFINE CONDITION IN QUERY.

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY LIST EMPLOYEE WHOSE SALARY IS MORE THAN 2500 ?


LOGICAL OPERATORS:
====================
	- TO CHECK MORE THAN ONE CONDITION.
	- AND , OR , NOT 

AND:
=====
	- IT RETURNS A VALUE WHEN ALL CONDITIONS ARE TRUE IN THE GIVEN QUERY.

COND1	COND2
======	=======
T	T	T
T	F	F
F	T	F
F	F	F

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEE WHO ARE WORKING IN JOB IS "CLERK" AND WHOSE NAME IS "SMITH" ?

OR:
===
	- IT RETURNS A VALUE IF ANY ONE CONDITION IS TRUE IN THE GIVEN QUERY.

COND1	COND2
======	======
T	T	T
T	F	T
F	T	T
F	F	F

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEE WHOSE EMPNO IS 7369,7788,7566 ?

NOT:
====
	- IT RETURNS ALL VALUES EXCEPT THE GIVEN CONDITIONAL VALUES IN THE QUERY.

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEE WHO ARE NOT WORKING IN JOB IS "CLERK" AND "SALESMAN" ?


6. SPECIAL OPERATORS		=>	(+ve) OPERATOR		(-ve) OPERATORS
					==============		================
					IN			NOT IN
					BETWEEN		NOT BETWEEN
					IS NULL			IS NOT NULL
					LIKE			NOT LIKE


IN :
===
	- COMPARING THE LIST OF VALUES IN THE GIVEN CONDITION.
	- IF A VALUE IS AVAIABLE IN THE LIST THEN IT RETURNS TRUE OTHERWISE RETURNS FALSE.

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY LIST OF EMPLOYEE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE JOB IS "MANAGER","ANALYST","PRESIDENT"?

BETWEEN:
=========
	- WORKING ON THE GIVEN RANGE VALUE.

BASIC RULES:
============
1. RETURNS VALUES INCLUDING SOURCE & DESTINATION VALUES. 
BETWEEN 10 - 20 
	> 10,11,12,................,19,20 ------------ OK
	> 11,12,.....................,18,19------------ X 

2. IS ALWAYS WORK ON LOW TO HIGH
BETWEEN 20 - 10
	> 10,11,12,................,19,20 -------------X
	> 11,12,.....................,18,19------------X
	> 20,19,........................,11,10---------X
	> 19,18,........................,12,11----------X
	> NO RETURN VALUE-------OK

3. CAN IMPLEMENT WITH "AND" OPERATOR ONLY.

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEE WHOSE SALARY BETWEEN 1500 AND 3000?

IS NULL:
=======
	- COMPARING "NULL" IN A TABLE COLUMN.

EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY EMPLOYEE WHOSE COMMISSION IS 0 ?

NOTE:
=====
1. NULL IS A UNKNOW / UNDEFINE VALUE IN DB.

	IN DB 
		> INT,FLOAT,STRING CHAR,STRING ALPHA,DATE,TIME,BINARY


= ,< ,>,..........NOT SUPPORT

2. NULL != 0 , NULL != SPACE
==============================================================================================
EX:
WAQ TO DISPLAY ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM AND SAL+COMM WHOSE ENAME NAME IS "SMITH" ?
